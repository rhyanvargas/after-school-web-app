Afterschool Maryland showcases youth programs in Maryland that offer a diverse set of resources for children aged anywhere from 5-19 years old. Each program is easily accessible and affordable. Youth voices need to be heard, not drowned out. After School Maryland seeks to highlight those voices by lifting up programs that truly empower youth, and engage with them in a holsitic manner.
